RFM Analysis - Customer Segmentation
This project performs an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

📁 Project Structure
RFM1 (1).ipynb : Jupyter Notebook containing the complete RFM analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, segmentation, and visualization.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📋 What is RFM Analysis?
RFM Analysis is a marketing technique used to identify and segment customers based on:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.

Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.

Monetary Value (M): How much money a customer spends.

By analyzing these three factors, businesses can target their marketing strategies more effectively.
